## Introduction

Bash scripts are small, powerful tools that can automate tasks and simplify repetitive actions in the command line. This repository houses some of the random bash scripts I've developed over time. Each script is accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose and usage.

## Scripts

Here are some of the bash scripts included in this repository:

1. `hello_world.sh`: A simple "Hello, World!" script to demonstrate the basic structure of a bash script.

2. `script_name.sh`: This script moves files around, but I don't remember. I need to read it again.


Feel free to browse the `/scripts` directory to explore all the available scripts.

I've created a video walkthrough where I explain the `hello_world.sh` script and provide some insights into its execution. Click on the thumbnail above to watch.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this repository, simply download the script file you're interested in and run it in your terminal:

```bash
